## Quickstart

This requires Browserbase API credentials, which you can get from the [Browserbase settings page](https://www.browserbase.com/settings). We also use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to manage dependencies, so make sure you have that installed.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand-studio
cd stagehand-studio

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the app
pnpm run dev
```

> [!WARNING]  
> We strongly encourage you to use the Node environment, as opposed to other alternatives like Bun.
