#### `act()`

`act()` allows Stagehand to interact with a web page. Provide an `action` like `"search for 'x'"`, or `"select the cheapest flight presented"` (small atomic goals perform the best).

- **Arguments:**

  - `action`: a `string` describing the action to perform
  - `modelName`: (optional) an `AvailableModel` string to specify the model to use
  - `modelClientOptions`: (optional) configuration options for the model client
  - `useVision`: (optional) a `boolean` or `"fallback"` to determine if vision-based processing should be used. Defaults to `"fallback"`
  - `variables`: (optional) a `Record<string, string>` of variables to use in the action. Variables in the action string are referenced using `%variable_name%`
  - `domSettleTimeoutMs`: (optional) timeout in milliseconds for waiting for the DOM to settle

- **Returns:**

  - A `Promise` that resolves to an object containing:
    - `success`: a `boolean` indicating if the action was completed successfully.
    - `message`: a `string` providing details about the action's execution.
    - `action`: a `string` describing the action performed.

- **Example:**

  ```javascript
  // Basic usage
  await stagehand.act({ action: "click on add to cart" });

  // Using variables
  await stagehand.act({
    action: "enter %username% into the username field",
    variables: {
      username: "john.doe@example.com",
    },
  });

  // Multiple variables
  await stagehand.act({
    action: "fill in the form with %username% and %password%",
    variables: {
      username: "john.doe",
      password: "secretpass123",
    },
  });
  ```

#### `extract()`

`extract()` grabs structured text from the current page using [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod). Given instructions and `schema`, you will receive structured data. Unlike some extraction libraries, stagehand can extract any information on a page, not just the main article contents.

- **Arguments:**

  - `instruction`: a `string` providing instructions for extraction
  - `schema`: a `z.AnyZodObject` defining the structure of the data to extract
  - `modelName`: (optional) an `AvailableModel` string to specify the model to use
  - `modelClientOptions`: (optional) configuration options for the model client
  - `domSettleTimeoutMs`: (optional) timeout in milliseconds for waiting for the DOM to settle

- **Returns:**

  - A `Promise` that resolves to the structured data as defined by the provided `schema`.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  const price = await stagehand.extract({
    instruction: "extract the price of the item",
    schema: z.object({
      price: z.number(),
    }),
  });
  ```

#### `observe()`

> [!NOTE]
> `observe()` currently only evaluates the first chunk in the page.

`observe()` is used to get a list of actions that can be taken on the current page. It's useful for adding context to your planning step, or if you unsure of what page you're on.

If you are looking for a specific element, you can also pass in an instruction to observe via: `observe({ instruction: "{your instruction}"})`.

- **Arguments:**

  - `instruction`: (optional) a `string` providing instructions for the observation. Defaults to "Find actions that can be performed on this page."
  - `modelName`: (optional) an `AvailableModel` string to specify the model to use
  - `modelClientOptions`: (optional) configuration options for the model client
  - `useVision`: (optional) a `boolean` to determine if vision-based processing should be used. Defaults to `false`
  - `domSettleTimeoutMs`: (optional) timeout in milliseconds for waiting for the DOM to settle

- **Returns:**

  - A `Promise` that resolves to an array of objects containing:
    - `selector`: a `string` representing the element selector
    - `description`: a `string` describing the possible action

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  const actions = await stagehand.observe();
  ```

#### `close()`

`close()` is a cleanup method to remove the temporary files created by Stagehand. It's highly recommended that you call this when you're done with your automation.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  await stagehand.close();
  ```

#### `page` and `context`

`page` and `context` are instances of Playwright's `Page` and `BrowserContext` respectively. Use these methods to interact with the Playwright instance that Stagehand is using. Most commonly, you'll use `page.goto()` to navigate to a URL.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  await stagehand.page.goto("https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand");
  ```

### `log()`

`log()` is used to print a message to the browser console. These messages will be persisted in the Browserbase session logs, and can be used to debug sessions after they've completed.

Make sure the log level is above the verbose level you set when initializing the Stagehand instance.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  stagehand.log("Hello, world!");
  ```
