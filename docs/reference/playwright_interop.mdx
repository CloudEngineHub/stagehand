Stagehand is built on top of [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), so you can use Playwright methods directly through the Stagehand instance.

## `page` and `context`

For actions that are not supported by Stagehand, you can use Playwright methods directly through the `page` and `context` objects. `page` and `context` are instances of Playwright's `Page` and `BrowserContext` respectively. Use these methods to interact with the Playwright instance that Stagehand is using. 

Most commonly, you'll use `page.goto()` to navigate to a URL.

```javascript
await stagehand.page.goto("https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand");
```
