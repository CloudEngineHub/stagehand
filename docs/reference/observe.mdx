`observe()` is used to get a list of actions that can be taken on the current page. It's useful for adding context to your planning step, or if you unsure of what page you're on.

If you are looking for a specific element, you can also pass in an instruction to observe via: `observe({ instruction: "{your instruction}"})`.

- **Arguments:**

  - `instruction`: (optional) a `string` providing instructions for the observation. Defaults to "Find actions that can be performed on this page."
  - `modelName`: (optional) an `AvailableModel` string to specify the model to use
  - `modelClientOptions`: (optional) configuration options for the model client
  - `useVision`: (optional) a `boolean` to determine if vision-based processing should be used. Defaults to `false`
  - `domSettleTimeoutMs`: (optional) timeout in milliseconds for waiting for the DOM to settle

- **Returns:**

  - A `Promise` that resolves to an array of objects containing:
    - `selector`: a `string` representing the element selector
    - `description`: a `string` describing the possible action

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  const actions = await stagehand.observe();
  ```
