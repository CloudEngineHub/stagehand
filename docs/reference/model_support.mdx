Stagehand leverages a generic LLM client architecture to support various language models from different providers. This design allows for flexibility, enabling the integration of new models with minimal changes to the core system. Different models work better for different tasks, so you can choose the model that best suits your needs.

#### Currently Supported Models

Stagehand currently supports the following models from OpenAI and Anthropic:

- **OpenAI Models:**

  - `gpt-4o`
  - `gpt-4o-mini`
  - `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`

- **Anthropic Models:**
  - `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`
  - `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`
  - `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`

These models can be specified when initializing the `Stagehand` instance or when calling methods like `act()` and `extract()`.
