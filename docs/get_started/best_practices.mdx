## Prompting Tips

Prompting Stagehand is more literal and atomic than other higher level frameworks, including agentic frameworks. Here are some guidelines to help you craft effective prompts:

### Do

**Use specific and concise actions**

```javascript
await stagehand.act({ action: "click the login button" });

const productInfo = await stagehand.extract({
  instruction: "find the red shoes",
  schema: z.object({
    productName: z.string(),
    price: z.number(),
  }),
});
```

**Break down complex tasks into smaller, atomic steps**

Instead of combining actions:

```javascript
// Avoid this
await stagehand.act({ action: "log in and purchase the first item" });
```

Split them into individual steps:

```javascript
await stagehand.act({ action: "click the login button" });
// ...additional steps to log in...
await stagehand.act({ action: "click on the first item" });
await stagehand.act({ action: "click the purchase button" });
```

**Use `observe()` to get actionable suggestions from the current page**

```javascript
const actions = await stagehand.observe();
console.log("Possible actions:", actions);
```

### Don't

**Use broad or ambiguous instructions**

```javascript
// Too vague
await stagehand.act({ action: "find something interesting on the page" });
```

**Combine multiple actions into one instruction**

```javascript
// Avoid combining actions
await stagehand.act({ action: "fill out the form and submit it" });
```

**Expect Stagehand to perform high-level planning or reasoning**

```javascript
// Outside Stagehand's scope
await stagehand.act({ action: "book the cheapest flight available" });
```

By following these guidelines, you'll increase the reliability and effectiveness of your web automations with Stagehand. Remember, Stagehand excels at executing precise, well-defined actions so keeping your instructions atomic will lead to the best outcomes.

We leave the agentic behavior to higher-level agentic systems which can use Stagehand as a tool.
